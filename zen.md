The Zen of Mokka
================

-	Explicit is better than implicit;
-	There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it;
-	Restrictive defaults are better than permissive defaults;
-	Runtime errors are a bug in the language;
-	Do not allow more than what is absolutely necessary;
-	If it is hard to explain, it is not a good idea;
-	A compiler error is better than a compiler warning;
-	Decisions must be made based upon data;
- Keep it realistic.
