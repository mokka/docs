# Introduction
This reference manual describes the Mokka's syntax and semantics. Mokka is still in its design phase; syntax and semantics in this
manual might change or be removed without notice. This reference manual tries to be complete and exact.

Semantics of non-essential built-in object types and functions will be described in the to be created Mokka Standard Library.

This manual tries to be as complete, precise but consice as possible. This document will mostly use natural language rather than formal
specification ([formal definitions can be found in the 'spec' repository](https://github.com/mokka/spec/)). This will make the
documentation much more readable, but somewhat more ambiguous.
