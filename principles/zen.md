# The Zen of Mokka

- Explicit is better than implicit;
- There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it;
- Restrictive defaults are better than permissive defaults;
- If it is the same, it must look the same;
- If it is different, it must look different;
- Runtime errors are a bug in the language;
- Do not allow more than what is absolutely necessary;
- If it is hard to explain, it is not a good idea;
- A compiler error is better than a compiler warning;
- Readability counts;
- Decisions should be made, based upon tests;
- Readability is more important than writability.
