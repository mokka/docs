Naming rules in Mokka
=====================

In contrast to most other languages, naming conventions are enforced by the compiler of Mokka. In other words, naming is part of the syntax.

This is similar to how written natural languages have capitalization as part of their syntax. (For example, the capitalization of nouns in the German language.)

The rules for names are as follows:

-	`snake_case` for local bindings
-	`lowerCamelCase` for functions and generators
-	`UpperCamelCase` for structures
